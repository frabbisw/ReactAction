# Simple deploy script example

echo "Starting deployment process..."

# Simulate deployment steps (e.g., building the app or uploading to a server)
# This is just an example, so modify it to fit your needs.

# Example: Build your React Native app (optional step)
echo "Building React Native app for production..."
npm run build  # Or use `react-native run-android` / `react-native run-ios` if needed

# Example: Copy files to a remote server (you can replace this with actual deployment commands)
echo "Deploying files to the server..."
# scp -r ./build/ user@server:/path/to/deploy

# If you're using a deployment platform, such as Firebase or Docker, you would replace this with the respective commands.

echo "Deployment complete!"
